The outputs of BERT are contextual embeddingsâ€”dense vector representations of words or tokens in a given input sequence. Letâ€™s break down what these outputs represent, how they are calculated, and how you can interpret them.

ðŸ§© What Are BERT Outputs?
When you input text into BERT, the model produces two main types of outputs:

Token-Level Output (Hidden States): Contextual embeddings for each token in the input sequence.
Sequence-Level Output: A pooled embedding for the entire input sequence, derived from the [CLS] token.
These outputs are not scores or probabilities by themselves. Instead, they are dense vector representations that capture the semantic meaning of the tokens or sequences within their context.

âœ… 1. Token-Level Output (Hidden States)
The primary output of BERT is a tensor of embeddings for each token in the input sequence.

Shape: (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)
batch_size: Number of input samples.
sequence_length: Number of tokens in each input sample.
hidden_size: Size of the embedding for each token (e.g., 768 for BERT-base, 1024 for BERT-large).
ðŸ”Ž What Does This Mean?
For each token in the input, BERT outputs a vector of size 768 or 1024 (depending on the model size). These vectors are contextual embeddings that represent the token's meaning in the given sentence context.

Example:

Input: "I love pizza"
Output: Embeddings for each token:
[CLS] â†’ A vector summarizing the entire sequence.
I â†’ A vector representing "I" in the context of the sentence.
love â†’ A vector representing "love" in the context of the sentence.
pizza â†’ A vector representing "pizza" in the context of the sentence.
[SEP] â†’ A special token indicating the end of the sentence.
âœ… 2. Sequence-Level Output (Pooled Output)
BERT also provides a pooled output from the [CLS] tokenâ€™s embedding.

Shape: (batch_size, hidden_size)
hidden_size: The size of the embedding for the [CLS] token (e.g., 768 for BERT-base).
ðŸ”Ž What Does This Mean?
The pooled output is a single vector summarizing the entire input sequence. Itâ€™s derived from the [CLS] tokenâ€™s final embedding, after applying a dense layer and an activation function.

This is the output typically used for classification tasks.

ðŸ“Š Are These Outputs Scores or Positions?
No, BERT outputs are not scores or positions. Instead, they are high-dimensional vectors that capture the semantic meaning of tokens and sequences in their specific context.

Hereâ€™s how to interpret them:

Output	Interpretation	Used For
Token Embeddings	Contextual meaning of each token	Token-level tasks (e.g., NER, QA)
Pooled Output	Summary of the entire sequence	Sequence-level tasks (e.g., text classification)
Attention Scores	Importance of one token relative to others	Understanding what the model focuses on
ðŸ§  How Does BERT Produce These Outputs?
Input Embedding Layer: Converts tokens into initial embeddings (sum of token, segment, and positional embeddings).
Transformer Layers (Self-Attention + Feedforward):
BERT has multiple transformer layers (12 for BERT-base, 24 for BERT-large).
Each layer updates the embeddings based on the context.
Final Hidden States: The embeddings after the last transformer layer are the token embeddings.
Pooled Output: Derived from the [CLS] tokenâ€™s final embedding, often used for classification tasks.
